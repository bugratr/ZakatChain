ZakatChain is an innovative platform designed to digitize the zakat giving process using the HAQQ network, an EVM-compatible blockchain. With ZakatChain, users can seamlessly register to request zakat, and donors can contribute with full transparency.


## 🌟 Features

- **Transparent Transactions**: All donations are recorded transparently on the HAQQ blockchain.
